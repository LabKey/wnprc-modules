# June --th, 2016 Update
* On the [Data Entry](https://labkeybaseurl.com/wnprc_ehr/WNPRC/EHR/dataEntry.view) page, the links have been moved to above the Manage Tasks/Requests tabs.
  * This is to prevent the links from jumping around when the task lists load.
* Necropsy Requests
  * You can now request necropsies from the data entry page.
* [Unified Biopsy/Necropsy Case List](https://labkeybaseurl.com/jsp/WNPRC/EHR/WNPRC_PathologyCaseList.view)

# January 1st, 2016 Update

* Added **What's New** change tracker.
* In [Irregular Observations](), the "performedby" field (and the "userid" field in cageobs) is now a drop-down, rather than a free text field. (*{{WNPRC#4409}}*)
  * The database will now only store the user's ID number, rather than the user's name.
* Increased default number of rows from 100 to 250 on the [Blood Draw Schedule](https://labkeybaseurl.com/ehr/WNPRC/EHR/animalHistory.view#inputType:none&showReport:1&activeReport:todaysBlood). (*{{WNPRC#4425}}*)
* When entering [Biopsy](https://labkeybaseurl.com/ehr/WNPRC/EHR/manageTask.view?formtype=Biopsy) and [Necropsy](https://labkeybaseurl.com/ehr/WNPRC/EHR/manageTask.view?formtype=Necropsy) forms, case numbers are incremented together. (*{{WNPRC#4437}}*)
  *  For instance, in the old way, you would see the following sequence:
    1. 2015b001
    2. 2015x001
    3. 2015c001
    4. 2015c002
    5. 2015x002
  * Now, you'll see this behavior:
    1. 2015b001
    2. 2015x002
    3. 2015c003
    4. 2015c004
    5. 2015x005
